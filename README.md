# CS255
In CS 255, we were tasked with designing a program for a client, DriverPass. DriverPass wanted a learning platform to help users pass their DMV Licensing Tests. Besides learning modules, they needed a system to schedule in-person driving instruction appointments. I created Business Requirements Documentation and System Design Documentation to clearly outline the user stories and system capabilities for both our team and the client.

One area I would revise is the use case diagram in my System Design Documentation. It currently shows both users and admins having the same access, which doesn't accurately reflect the admin's specific use cases.

Regarding user needs, I believe I effectively addressed the client's customers' requirements. Ensuring a positive user experience is crucial since dissatisfied users might cancel their membership and blame our client. If admins encounter issues, they can contact us directly.

In software design, understanding and prioritizing user stories is essential. Creating a plan for implementation using Big Visual Charts can foster team cooperation and unity. Agile development emphasizes customer focus, so it's important to center development around user stories.
